# AnimeInspiration
Program that sends encouraging and motivating messages to the user based off of anime character quotes.
I plan on having two settings which determine which sort of messages you can recieve.
Mode #1, which will be a use of simple terms and optimism for perhaps a younger audience (goofy quotes).
Mode #2, which will be a use for mostly older audiences (more mature types of motivation.
